Generally, if a subroutine will process a list of options, C<@options>,
that subroutine will also process an array reference, C<\@options>, C<[@options]>,
or hash reference, C<\%options>, C<{@options}>.
If a subroutine will process an array reference, C<\@options>, C<[@options]>,
that subroutine will also process a hash reference, C<\%options>, C<{@options}>.
See the description for a subroutine for details and exceptions.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Different operating systems have different sequences for new-lines.
Historically when computers where first being born, 
one of the mainstays was the teletype. 
The teletype understood L<ASCII|http:E<sol>E<sol>ascii.computerdiamonds.com>.
The teletype was an automated typewriter that would perform a 
carriage return when it received an ASCII Carriage Return (CR), \015,  character
and a new line when it received a Line Feed (LF), \012 character.

After some time came Unix. Unix had a tty driver that had a raw mode that
sent data unprocessed to a teletype and a cooked mode that performed all
kinds of translations and manipulations. Unix stored data internally using
a single NL character at the ends of lines. The tty driver in the cooked
mode would translate the New Line (NL) character to a CR,LF sequence. 
When driving a teletype, the physicall action of performing a carriage
return took some time. By always putting the CR before the LF, the
teletype would actually still be performing a carriage return when it
received the LF and started a line feed.

After some time came DOS. Since the tty driver is actually one of the largest
peices of code for UNIX and DOS needed to run in very cramp space,
the DOS designers decided, that instead of writing a tailored down tty driver,
they would stored a CR,LF in the internal memory. Data internally would be
either 'text' data or 'binary' data.

Needless to say, after many years and many operating systems about every
conceivable method of storing new lines may be found amoung the various
operating systems.
This greatly complicates moving files from one operating system to
another operating system.

The smart NL methods in this package are designed to take any combination
of CR and NL and translate it into the special NL seqeunce used on the
site operating system. Thus, by using these methods, the messy problem of 
moving files between operating systems is mostly hidden in these methods.
By using the C<fin> and C<fout> methods, text files may be freely exchanged between
operating systems without any other processing. 

The one thing not hidden is that the methods need to know if the data is
'text' data or 'binary' data. Normally, the assume the data is 'text' and
are overriden by setting the 'binary' option.

Perl 5.6 introduced a built-in smart nl functionality as an IO discipline :crlf.
See I<Programming Perl> by Larry Wall, Tom Christiansen and Jon Orwant,
page 754, Chapter 29: Functions, open function.
For Perl 5.6 or above, the :crlf IO discipline my be preferable over the
smart_nl method of this program module.

=head1 SUBROUTINES

=head2 config

 $old_value = config( $option );
 $old_value = config( $option => $new_value);
 (@all_options) = config( );

When Perl loads 
the C<File::SmartNL> program module,
Perl creates a
C<$File::Drawing::default_options> object
using the C<default> method.

Using the C<config> as a subroutine 

 config(@_) 

writes and reads
the C<$File::Drawing::default_options> object
directly using the L<Data::Startup::config|Data::Startup/config>
method.
Avoided the C<config> and in multi-threaded environments
where separate threads are using C<File::Drawing>.
All other subroutines are multi-thread safe.
They use C<override> to obtain a copy of the 
C<$File::Drawing::default_options> and apply any option
changes to the copy keeping the original intact.

Using the C<config> as a method,

 $options->config(@_)

writes and reads the C<$options> object
using the L<Data::Startup::config|Data::Startup/config>
method.
It goes without saying that that object
should have been created using one of
the following or equivalent:

 $default_options = $class->File::Drawing::defaults(@_);

The underlying object data for the C<File::SmartNL>
class of objects is a hash. For object oriented
conservative purist, the C<config> subroutine is
the accessor function for the underlying object
hash.

Since the data are all options whose names and
usage is frozen as part of the C<File::Drawing>
interface, the more liberal minded, may avoid the
C<config> accessor function layer, and access the
object data directly.

=head2 defaults

The C<defaults> subroutine establish C<File::Drawing> class wide options
options as follows:

 option                  initial value
 --------------------------------------------
 warn                      1
 binary                    0

=head2 fin

 $data = fin( $file_name )
 $data = fin( $file_name, @options )
 $data = fin( $file_name, [@options] )
 $data = fin( $file_name, {@options} )

For the C<binary> option, the C<fin> subroutine reads
C<$data> from the C<$file_name> as it; otherwise, it converts
any CR LF sequence to the
the logical Perl C<\n> character for site.

=head2 fout

 $success = fout($file_name, $data)
 $success = fout($file_name, $data, @options)
 $success = fout($file_name, $data, [@options])
 $success = fout($file_name, $data, {@options})

For the C<binary> option, the C<fout> subroutine writes out the
C<$data> to the C<$file_name> as it; otherwise, it converts
the logical Perl C<\n> character to th site CR LF sequence for a NL.

=head2 smart_nl 

  $data = smart_nl( $data  )

The C<smart_nl> subroutine converts any combination of
CR and LF to the NL of the site operationg system.

Running the test script C<SmartNL.t> verifies
the requirements for this module.
The C<tmake.pl> cover script for L<Test::STDmaker|Test::STDmaker>
automatically generated the
C<SmartNL.t> test script, C<SmartNL.d> demo script,
and C<t::File::SmartNL> STD program module POD,
from the C<t::File::SmartNL> program module contents.
The C<tmake.pl> cover script automatically ran the
C<SmartNL.d> demo script and inserted the results
into the 'DEMONSTRATION' section above.
The  C<t::File::SmartNL> program module
is in the distribution file
F<File-SmartNL-$VERSION.tar.gz>.
